# Import strings for customized WoW UI (Season of Discovery)
Import strings for my WoW UI.

For the addons, find the Profiles -> Import section and paste the respective strings in the textareas and apply.

- ElvUI
- WeakAuras (If I did not play the class seriously yet in SoD it will not be here).
- Details

WA is currently for mage only. ElvUI and Details are class agnostic and recommended for any class.
